Mirror Neovim's Lua API namespaces (maki.uv = vim.uv, maki.fs = vim.fs, maki.treesitter = vim.treesitter).
Keep function signatures identical so plugins can be copy-pasted between Neovim and maki.
Only exception is the UI API, neovim's has baggage.

## Design

Our goal is to let plugin authors have as much freedom as possible, that's why desiging the APIs should be looked at as simple primitives you combine together.

## Error convention

Fallible runtime operations return the pair (value, err) and never throw.
Throwing is reserved for programmer errors, like passing a number where a string belongs.
