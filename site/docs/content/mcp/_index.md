# MCP (Model Context Protocol)

n00n connects to external tool servers over MCP. Both **stdio** and **HTTP** transports are supported.

## Configuration

Add servers under `[mcp.*]` in your MCP config:

- **Global**: `~/.config/n00n/mcp.toml`
- **Project**: `.n00n/mcp.toml` (project config wins when both set a value)

### Stdio

```toml
[mcp.filesystem]
command = ["npx", "-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/tmp"]

[mcp.github]
command = ["gh", "mcp-server"]
environment = { GITHUB_TOKEN = "ghp_xxxx" }
timeout = 10000
enabled = false
```

### HTTP

```toml
[mcp.analytics]
url = "https://mcp.example.com/mcp"
headers = { Authorization = "Bearer tok123" }
```

### All options

| Field | Type | Default | Notes |
|-------|------|---------|-------|
| `command` | array | | Stdio: program + args |
| `url` | string | | HTTP: server URL |
| `environment` | map | | Stdio only |
| `headers` | map | | HTTP only |
| `timeout` | u64 | 30000 | Milliseconds (1-300000) |
| `enabled` | bool | true | |
| `always_load` | bool | false | Skip tool search, load all tools upfront |

Set `command` for stdio, `url` for HTTP. Pick one.

One option lives at the top level of `mcp.toml`, outside any server:

| Field | Type | Default | Notes |
|-------|------|---------|-------|
| `defer_tools` | usize | 10 | Defer tools only when more than this many exist |

## Tool search

Every tool definition a server exposes costs context window space, on every request. Big servers like GitHub's ship dozens of tools when a task often needs three.

So Maki, like Claude Code, defers MCP tools by default. The model sees one small `tool_search` tool that lists the deferred names, searches when it actually needs something, and the matches stay loaded for the rest of the session. Resume a session and the tools it was using come back. Subagents keep their own loads, so their searches don't bloat your main conversation.

You don't configure anything for this. Add servers, and only the tools the model actually uses take up context.

With 10 or fewer tools across all your servers there is no search step: at that size, searching costs more than it saves, so everything loads upfront. The top-level `defer_tools` key moves that line:

```toml
defer_tools = 30

[mcp.github]
url = "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/"
```

Set it to 0 to always defer, or above your tool count to never defer.

If one server should skip the search step entirely, opt it out:

```toml
[mcp.linear]
command = ["linear-mcp-server"]
always_load = true
```

Good for small servers you rely on every turn. On a big server it defeats the point: every definition is back in your context on every request.

## Naming and namespacing

Server names are ASCII alphanumeric, hyphens ok. Tools get prefixed with their server name: a `read` tool on the `filesystem` server becomes `filesystem__read`. Because of this, `__` is reserved and names can't collide with built-in tools.

## Runtime toggling

Turn servers on/off from the MCP picker in the UI. Changes save back to your config.

## Status

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Connecting | Waiting for the server to come up |
| Running | Tools available |
| Disabled | Off in config or toggled off in UI |
| Failed | Error shown in UI |
| NeedsAuth | Waiting for OAuth (see below) |

If one server fails, the rest still work.

## OAuth

Some HTTP servers need auth. When that happens, n00n opens your browser to log in. Other servers keep working while you authenticate. Tokens refresh on their own. If you change the server URL, you log in again.

```bash
n00n mcp auth <server-name>     # manually trigger auth
n00n mcp logout <server-name>   # remove stored tokens
```

### Headless machines

On a machine without a browser (say, a dev server over SSH), run `n00n mcp auth <server-name>`. n00n prints the login URL. Open it on your laptop and log in. The browser lands on a `http://127.0.0.1:19876/...` page that fails to load. Copy that full URL from the address bar and paste it into the terminal to finish the login.

## Prompts

MCP servers can expose prompts (reusable message templates). n00n shows them as slash commands in the command palette: `/server:prompt-name`. Type `/` to filter.

```
/github:create-pr           # no arguments
/analytics:report monthly   # one argument
/review:code src tests      # multiple, positional
```

Skip a required argument and n00n shows a usage hint. Prompts are fetched at startup and on reconnect, so new ones need a restart. Only text content is supported.
